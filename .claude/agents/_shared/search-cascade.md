# Search Cascade — never let one provider end the research

## Search only when it earns its cost

Training data runs to roughly **May 2026**. Settled questions — established language
features, library behavior predating the cutoff, general design patterns, algorithms —
should be answered directly. Reserve searching for: anything after ~May 2026, exact
current values (version, API signature, config key, price, limit), niche or fast-churning
libraries, and claims you wouldn't stake shipped code on.

Answering from knowledge is a valid outcome. Say so plainly, cite nothing, and
**never invent a URL to make recalled knowledge look sourced**.

## When you do search, work down this ladder

| # | Provider | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Context7** (`mcp__plugin_context7_*`) | For library/API questions this beats web search. Try first when the question names a library |
| 2 | **Exa** (`mcp__exa__*`) | Primary web research. Semantic search + full page content |
| 3 | **Jina** via `WebFetch` | **No key, no account.** Search: `https://s.jina.ai/{url-encoded-query}` · Read a page: `https://r.jina.ai/{url}`. ~20 req/min |
| 4 | **WebSearch** (built-in) | No quota, always available — the cascade cannot fully fail. Broad and general-purpose, weaker on code |

Move to the next rung on **429 / quota exhausted / auth error / timeout / empty results**.
Exa's free tier is ~1000 requests a month and it does run out — that is a reason to step
down a rung, not a reason to give up.

**Do not** fan the same query across all four "for completeness" — descend only on failure
or genuinely thin results.

## Gotchas

- Jina renders JavaScript, but heavy SPAs sometimes return a truncated page. Suspiciously
  short content from a page that should be long is an extraction failure, not an empty
  page — retry via `mcp__exa__web_fetch_exa` or move on.
- MCP tool responses are capped at 25k tokens in Claude Code. Ask for narrower content
  rather than fighting the cap.
- Report which rung produced your answer, so quota problems surface instead of silently
  degrading research quality.
