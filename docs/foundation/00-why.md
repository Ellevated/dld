# Why DLD: The Entrepreneur's Pain

## The Core Problem

An entrepreneur with a strong product vision faces a bottleneck:

```
Idea in head → [?] → Working product
```

**The classic path:**
1. Hire developers
2. Explain the vision
3. Wait months
4. Get "almost what you wanted"
5. Scale through hiring and management

**Problems with the classic path:**
- Slow and expensive
- "People do it their own way" — loss of vision
- Entrepreneur becomes a manager, not a creator
- Ideas remain "in the head" due to friction

---

## Key Observation

> **The bottleneck is not the idea, but the speed of changes.**

The entrepreneur should be:
- Source of meaning
- UX tester
- Product decision maker

The entrepreneur should NOT be:
- Development micromanager
- Task dispatcher
- Translator between "business" and "tech"

## What's Valuable in an Entrepreneur

| Magic | Routine |
|-------|---------|
| Live UX testing | Task assignment |
| "This is inconvenient" / "Aha!" | Developer coordination |
| Product decisions | Code review |
| New meanings | Deploy and monitoring |

**DLD takes the routine → frees up the magic.**

---

## The Root Cause of DLD

1. **Entrepreneur generates meanings**, not manages routine
2. **Speed of changes** — the main metric, not the number of features
3. **Implementation correctness** — feature must work as intended
4. **Autonomy** — human is the final UX judge, not a craftsman

## "Green Buttons"

Validation principle: if you implemented "green buttons", they must be:
- Actually green
- Work correctly

If it looks stupid — **it's a stupid idea, not bad code**.

DLD must implement the idea exactly so that:
- Good idea → immediately visible that it's good
- Bad idea → immediately visible that it's bad (and can quickly change)

---

## Summary

```
Before DLD:  Idea → [months] → Compromise → "Well, kinda works"
After:       Idea → [hours]  → Exact implementation → Clear understanding
```
