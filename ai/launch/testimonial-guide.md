# Testimonial Collection Guide

## Why Collect Testimonials

- Social proof increases conversion
- Real stories are more compelling than features
- Shows DLD works for different use cases

## Where to Find Users

1. **Discord** — active users asking questions
2. **GitHub Issues** — people who fixed bugs or contributed
3. **Twitter/X** — mentions of DLD
4. **Reddit** — posts in r/ClaudeAI, r/programming

## How to Ask

### Template Message

```
Hey [Name]!

I noticed you're using DLD for [project/context]. That's awesome!

Would you be open to sharing a quick testimonial? Just 1-2 sentences about your experience.

Examples:
- "DLD reduced my debugging time by X%"
- "The spec-first approach changed how I work with AI"
- "Finally, AI coding that doesn't break everything"

No pressure—just thought I'd ask! 🙏
```

### Follow-up Questions (if they agree)

1. What was your biggest pain point before DLD?
2. What specific improvement did you notice?
3. Would you recommend DLD? Why?
4. Can we use your GitHub handle and project name?

## Testimonial Format

```markdown
> "[Quote - 1-2 sentences, specific benefit]"
> — **@github_handle**, [Project Name](url)
```

### Good Examples

> "DLD turned my 3-hour debugging sessions into 15-minute reviews. The fresh subagent approach is genius."
> — **@developer**, [project-name](url)

> "I was skeptical about another AI methodology. Then I tried spec-first development. Now I can't go back."
> — **@developer**, [project-name](url)

### Bad Examples (too vague)

> "Great tool!" — lacks specificity
> "DLD is amazing" — no concrete benefit
> "I like it" — not quotable

## Criteria for README Inclusion

1. **Real project** — must have GitHub repo or live URL
2. **Verifiable** — we can confirm they use DLD
3. **Specific** — quote mentions concrete benefit
4. **Permission** — explicit OK to use their name
