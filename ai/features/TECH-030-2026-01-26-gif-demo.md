# Feature: [TECH-030] GIF Demo for README

**Status:** queued | **Priority:** P0 | **Date:** 2026-01-26

## Why

README without visual demo loses 80% of visitors in first 10 seconds. GIF shows workflow faster than reading. This is the #1 driver for GitHub stars.

## Context

Current README has Mermaid diagrams (static) but no actual demo of the tool in action.

---

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Create recording script (what to show)
- Add GIF placeholder section to README
- Create `assets/demo/` folder structure
- Write recording instructions in `ai/launch/gif-recording-guide.md`

**Out of scope:**
- Actual recording (manual task)
- Video editing (manual task)

---

## Allowed Files

**New files:**
1. `ai/launch/gif-recording-guide.md` — step-by-step recording script
2. `assets/demo/.gitkeep` — placeholder for demo assets

**Modify:**
3. `README.md` — add demo section after badges

**FORBIDDEN:** All other files.

## Environment

## Design

### README addition (after badges, before "The Problem"):

```markdown
## See It In Action

![DLD Workflow Demo](assets/demo/workflow.gif)

*From idea to shipped code in 3 commands: `/bootstrap` → `/spark` → `/autopilot`*
```

### Recording Script (`ai/launch/gif-recording-guide.md`):

```markdown
# GIF Recording Guide

## Setup
- Terminal: Dark theme, large font (16px+)
- Resolution: 1280x720
- Tool: Kap (macOS), OBS (cross-platform), asciinema

## Scene 1: Project Creation (10s)
\`\`\`
npx create-dld demo-project
cd demo-project
\`\`\`

## Scene 2: Bootstrap (20s)
\`\`\`
claude
> /bootstrap
\`\`\`
Show: Answering 2-3 questions, idea extraction

## Scene 3: Spark (20s)
\`\`\`
> /spark add user authentication
\`\`\`
Show: Research happening, spec being created

## Scene 4: Autopilot (20s)
\`\`\`
> /autopilot
\`\`\`
Show: Tasks executing, commits appearing

## Scene 5: Result (10s)
\`\`\`
git log --oneline
\`\`\`
Show: Clean commit history

## Total: ~80 seconds

## Post-Processing
1. Speed up waiting parts 2x
2. Add captions at key moments
3. Convert to GIF: `ffmpeg -i demo.mp4 -vf "fps=10,scale=1280:-1" demo.gif`
4. Optimize: `gifsicle -O3 demo.gif -o workflow.gif`
5. Target size: <5MB for GitHub
```
