Yes, but DLD is designed for Claude Code...

### Can I use it with my existing project?
Yes, see migration guide...

## Workflow

### What's the difference between Skills and Agents?
Skills are user-facing commands (/spark, /autopilot)...

### How does Spark differ from Autopilot?
Spark creates specs, Autopilot implements them...

### What if Autopilot gets stuck?
See troubleshooting...

## Comparison

### How is DLD different from Superpowers?
See COMPARISON.md...
